The first was on the night of 78 April 1941, a small attack which probably took place only to test Belfast's defences. The next took place on Easter Tuesday, 15 April 1941. Two hundred bombers of the \"Luftwaffe\" attacked military and manufacturing targets in the city of Belfast. Some 900 people died as a result of the bombing and 1,500 were injured. High explosive bombs predominated in this raid. Apart from those on London, this was the greatest loss of life in any night raid during the Blitz.\n\nBombing of Yawata: The Japanese city of Yawata (which was incorporated into the larger city of Kitakyushu in 1963) was subjected to three major air raids during World War II, part of the U.S. strategic bombing campaign. The first raid took place on the night of 15/16 June 1944. This was the first attack on the Japanese home islands by United States Army Air Forces bombers since the Doolittle Raid of 1942. The city was next attacked during the day and night of 20 August 1944. These two attacks caused little damage to the city's industrial facilities. The third raid was conducted on 8 August 1945 and resulted in 21 percent of Yawata's urban area being destroyed. The third raid may have spared nearby Kokura from destruction, as Kokura was to be the primary target for the second atomic bomb the following day, but smoke from the fires in Yawata combined with cloud cover decreased visibility to the point that the secondary target of Nagasaki was bombed instead.\n\nThe Great Raid: The Great Raid is a 2005 war film about the Raid at Cabanatuan on the island of Luzon, Philippines during World War II. It is directed by John Dahl and stars Benjamin Bratt, James Franco, Connie Nielsen, Marton Csokas, Joseph Fiennes with Motoki Kobayashi and Cesar Montano. The principal photography took place from July 4, to November 6, 2002, but its release was delayed several times from the original target of fall 2003. The film is adapted from two books, William Breuer's \"The Great Raid on Cabanatuan City\" and Hampton Sides' \"Ghost Soldiers\".\n\nJameson Raid: The Jameson Raid (29 December 1895 \u2013 2 January 1896) was a botched raid against the South African Republic (commonly known as the Transvaal) carried out by British colonial statesman Leander Starr Jameson and his Company troops (\"police\" in the employ of Beit and Rhodes' British South Africa Company) and Bechuanaland policemen over the New Year weekend of 1895\u201396. Paul Kruger was president of the republic at the time. The raid was intended to trigger an uprising by the primarily British expatriate workers (known as Uitlanders) in the Transvaal but failed to do so. The workers were called the Johannesburg conspirators. They were expected to recruit an army and prepare for an insurrection. The raid was ineffective and no uprising took place, but it was an inciting factor in the Second Boer War and the Second Matabele War.\n\nAngur Ada raid: The Angur Ada raid (Pashto: \u062f \u0627\u0646\u06ab\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0689\u06d0 \u0628\u0631\u064a\u062f\u200e ) was a covert raid conducted by U.S. Navy SEALs against Taliban fighters on September 3, 2008, within the border town of Angur Ada in South Waziristan. It was the first time American Troops fought a ground-based battle against the Taliban within Pakistani borders. The raid took place at the same time as Pakistani military forces ended a four-week offensive in Bajaur, the northernmost Agency of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of which South Waziristan is the southernmost, an offensive that has displaced approximately half a million people.\n\nBill Bower: William Marsh \"Bill\" Bower (February 13, 1917 \u2013 January 10, 2011) was an American aviator, U.S. Air Force Colonel and veteran of World War II. Bower was the last surviving pilot of the Doolittle Raid, the first air raid to target the Japanese home island of Honshu.\n\nLes Munro: Squadron Leader John Leslie Munro, CNZM, DSO, QSO, DFC, JP (5 April 1919 \u2013 4 August 2015) was a Royal New Zealand Air Force pilot during World War II and the last surviving pilot of the Dambusters Raid of May 1943.\n\nAl-Khisas raid: The al-Khisas raid took place in al-Khisas in Mandatory Palestine on December 18, 1947, near to the Syrian border and was carried out by Haganah militiamen, possibly from Palmach. The raid was performed in reprisal to a shooting in which a passenger on a horse-cart from a nearby kibbutz was shot and killed earlier that day. Local Palmach commanders mistakenly assumed the shooting emanated from al-Khisas. The rationale at that time for the raid was that \"if there was no reaction to the murder, the Arabs would interpret this as a sign of weakness and an invitation to further attacks\". The Hagana High Command approved an attack on men only and the burning of a few houses. Twelve Arab residents of Al-Khisas were killed, four of them children. The Jewish leadership at the time sharply criticized the attack. Three weeks later, Arab forces crossed the Syrian border and carried out a reprisal attack on the kibbutz Kfar Szold, but suffered heavy losses and were repulsed. The events led to an escalation in violence that rapidly spread through the Upper Galilee region.\n\nRaid on Haverhill (1697): The Raid on Haverhill was a military engagement that took place on March 15, 1697 during King William's War. Ordered by Louis de Buade de Frontenac, Governor General of New France, French, Algonquin, and Abenaki warriors descended on Haverhill, then a small frontier community in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. In the surprise attack, the Abenaki killed 27 colonists and took 13 captive. The natives burned six homes. The raid became famous in the nineteenth century because of Hannah Dustin's captivity narrative as a result of the raid.\n\nRaid at Altenburg: The raid at Altenburg on 28 September 1813 took place during the War of the Sixth Coalition's Allied autumn campaign in Saxony. The raid was carried out by the \"Streifkorp\" under the command of Saxon General Johann von Thielmann commanding seven regiments of Cossacks, a squadron each of Saxon Hussars and Dragoons, and a detachment of \"Saxon Freikorps\" numbering about 1,500 cavalry. The objective of the raid was to attempt harassment of the French lines of communication 25 miles (45\u00a0km) south of Leipzig shortly before the Battle of Leipzig.\n\nQuestion: Bill Bower was the only surviving pilot of a raid that took place in what country?\n"
